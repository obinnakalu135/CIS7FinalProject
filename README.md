# CIS7FinalProject

For my project I am choosing the development of an encryption/decryption program. This can be used for password protection, the development of hidden languages that are only accessible by those with the encryption key, among other uses.

I found it useful to split all of the duties of the program into separate functions, and to keep the main function as a menu screen. I could have also made the menu a function itself, but decided not to.

Instructions:
1) Choose one of three options to either encrypt, decrypt, or exit program.
2) Enter message to encrypt/decrypt.
3) Enter key for message encryption/decryption.
4) Repeat step 1.
